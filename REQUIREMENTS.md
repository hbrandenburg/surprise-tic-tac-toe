# 5x5 Surprise Tic-Tac-Toe - Technical Requirements & Implementation

## Project Overview

A production-ready browser-based 5x5 tic-tac-toe game with surprise power-ups, designed for mobile-first restaurant entertainment. Players race against a 60-second timer to get 4-in-a-row while discovering hidden surprises.

## Architecture

**Single-File Application**
- One HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript (1,622 lines)
- No external dependencies or frameworks
- Progressive Web App (PWA) with service worker for offline capability
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach with comprehensive breakpoints

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Testing**: Jest (unit tests) + Playwright (E2E tests) + Lighthouse CI (performance)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD pipeline
- **PWA**: Service worker, manifest.json, offline capability
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized interface with 44px+ touch targets

## Core Systems (Implemented)

### 1. Game Engine (`GameEngine` class)
- 5x5 board state management (25-cell array)
- Turn logic with X/O player switching
- 4-in-a-row win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- 60-second countdown timer with visual warnings
- Timeout logic with piece counting for winner determination
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys and Enter/Space
- Touch event handling with visual feedback

### 2. Surprise System (`SurpriseManager` class)
- Random placement of exactly 10 power-ups (40% board coverage)
- 8 distinct power-up types with unique effects:
  - üéÅ Extra Turn - Skip opponent's next turn
  - ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip Turn - Force opponent to miss turn
  - üîÑ Switch Places - Swap current piece with random opponent piece
  - ‚ùå Remove Opponent - Remove random opponent piece
  - üõ°Ô∏è Safe Spot - Mark piece as protected from removal/switching
  - ‚ö° Speed Boost - Add 10 seconds to timer permanently
  - ‚ùÑÔ∏è Time Freeze - Pause timer for 5 seconds with visual effects
  - üé® Color Swap - Swap X/O colors temporarily for 5 seconds
- Animated popup reveals with descriptions
- Safe spot protection system preventing removal of protected pieces

### 3. Animation System (Embedded)
- CSS keyframe animations for 60fps performance
- Confetti celebration with 50 particles in 5 colors
- Piece placement animations with scale and rotation
- Timer warning pulses when ‚â§10 seconds
- Surprise reveal animations with scale effects
- Win message popups with bounce-in animations
- Touch ripple effects for mobile feedback

## Mobile Optimization Requirements

### Viewport Configuration
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
```

### Touch Interface
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Touch event handling (touchstart, touchend)
- Prevent zoom on double-tap
- Optimized for both portrait and landscape

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile Portrait: 320px - 480px
- Mobile Landscape: 480px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px

### Restaurant Environment Considerations
- High contrast colors for various lighting
- Large, easily tappable game cells
- Clear visual feedback for actions
- Minimal data usage (self-contained)

## Deployment Strategy

### GitHub Pages Setup
1. Repository structure with `index.html` in root
2. GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
3. Custom domain support (optional)
4. HTTPS by default

### Build Process
- HTML/CSS/JS minification
- Asset optimization
- PWA manifest generation
- Service worker for offline capability

## Performance Requirements

### Loading
- Initial load < 3 seconds on 3G
- Total file size < 500KB
- Lazy loading for non-critical assets

### Runtime
- 60fps animations
- Touch response < 100ms
- Memory usage < 50MB
